# Data Analytics for Drug Side Effect Profiling

This project focuses on **pharmacovigilance data analysis** to uncover potential correlations between **drugs and adverse events (side effects)**.  
The goal is to demonstrate the use of **data analytics in drug safety monitoring** and **signal detection**.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Simulation**: Created a dummy pharmacovigilance dataset with:
   - Drug names  
   - Reported side effects  
   - Number of cases  
   - Severity level (Mild, Moderate, Severe)  

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Frequency distribution of side effects  
   - Correlation between specific drugs and adverse events  
   - Signal detection (disproportionality analysis simulation)  

3. **Visualization**:
   - Bar plots of top side effects per drug  
   - Heatmap of drug vs. side effect correlations  

4. **Result Export**:
   - Findings saved into `drug_side_effect_analysis.csv`

## ðŸ“Š Example Insights
- **Drug A**: Strongly associated with Nausea and Dizziness  
- **Drug B**: Frequently linked to Headache and Insomnia  
- **Drug C**: Severe adverse events observed in rare cases  

*(All results are synthetic and for demonstration only.)*

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, Numpy** (data analysis)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This is a **dummy demonstration project** for showcasing skills in:
- **Healthcare Data Analytics**  
- **Pharmacovigilance**  
- **Drug Safety Signal Detection**  

No real patient-level data was used. All results are simulated.
